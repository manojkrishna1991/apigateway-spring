Creating a API Gateway using Spring Cloud gateway

This project is for a Spring Cloud Gateway that routes requests to different microservices based on the path of the request. It uses Spring Cloud Gateway's built-in routing capabilities to forward requests to the appropriate service and it can be used as a base reference for building a more complex API Gateway.
